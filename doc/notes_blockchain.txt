Bitcoin Blockchain
------------------

The bitcoin block-chain format is:

   block ::=    uint32      magic_number (0xd9b4bef9)
                uint32      nbytes       (excluding magic_number and nbytes)
                blockhdr    hdr
                varint      ntxs
                {tx}+       transaction array
  
   blockhdr ::= uint32      version_number (0x00000001 or 0x00000002)
                uint256     prev_block_hash
                uint256     merkle_root 
                uint32      time_stamp
                uint32      difficulty_bits
                uint32      nonce
 
   tx ::=       uint32      version_number
                varint      ninputs
                {input}+    input array
                varint      noutputs
                {output}+   output array
                uint32      lock_time
   
   input ::=    uint256     prev_hash
                uint32      prev_index
                script      input_script
                uint32      sequence
 
   output ::=   uint64      amount
                script      output_script
  
Input scripts generally just push data (e.g., a signature as proof of possessing
the private key) onto the stack which when used with the previous output script
evaluates to true (e.g., OP_CHECKSIG).

The hash of a block is the two-round sha256 hash of the blockhdr. The hash of a
transaction is the two-round sha256 hash of the tx. The merkle_root is the root
of the merkle tree of all hashes of the transactions.

Example output scripts:

     Standard Generation Transaction (pay-to-pubkey):
     script = OP_PUSHx41 publickey_uncompressed OP_CHECKSIG 
              | OP_PUSHx21 publickey_compressed OP_CHECKSIG

     Standard Transaction to Bitcoin address (pay-to-pubkey-hash)
     script = OP_DUP OP_HASH160 OP_PUSHx14 pubkey_hash 
                  OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
              | OP_HASH160 OP_PUSHx14 pubkey_hash OP_EQUAL

     Standard MiltiSig
     script = OP_X {OP_PUSH public_key}N OP_N OP_CHECKMULTISIG


Example input scripts:

     Standard Signature: 
     script = OP_PUSHxXX {DER_sig SIGHASH_ALL}
                  OP_PUSHx41 publickey_uncompressed
            | OP_PUSHxXX {DER_sig SIGHASH_ALL}
                  OP_PUSHx21 publickey_compressed

     DER_sig ::=  uint8       DER_type (sequence: 0x30) 
                  uint8       DER_length (nbytes of sequence) 
                  uint8       DER_type (integer 0x02)
                  uint8       DER_length (nbytes of the integer)
                  {uint8}+    r
                  uint8       DER_type (integer 0x02)
                  uint8       DER_length (nbytes of the integer)
                  {uint8}+    s

     DER_sig is the standard DER format of a pair of integers.
     The signature values (r,s) are the ECDSA values to sign the 
     two-round hash of the current tx (except that the previous
     transaction's input script is used and the SIGHASH_ALL tag
     is added to the end):

     txsig ::=    uint32      version_number
                  varint      ninputs
                  {inputsig}+ input array
                  varint      noutputs
                  {output}+   output array
                  uint32      lock_time
                  uint32      SIGHASH_ALL

     inputsig ::= uint256     prev_hash
                  uint32      prev_index
                  script      previous tx's output script
                  uint32      sequence



Truthcoin Blockchain
--------------------

Bitcoin's block chain can be viewed as a ledger of actions on a dataset. The
dataset is the set of all coin allocations to addresses and the actions are
the transfers of coins from a subset of addresses to other addresses. 

Truthcoin is a generalization of both the dataset and the set of actions.

Truthcoin's dataset consists of sets of:
   1. cashcoin allocations to public addresses
   2. votecoin allocations to public addresses
   3. branches
   4. decisions within each branch
   5. markets across a subset of decisions
   6. trades in each market
   7. ballots (votes on each decision, and hence market)
   8. outcomes of each decision (and hence market)

Truthcoin's actions consists of:
   1. all bitcoin-type transfers of cashcoins.
   2. creation of branches (note: this is done in a very limited fashion)
   3. creation of decisions
   4. creation of markets
   5. creation of trades
   6. creation of vote ballots
   7. publishing outcomes with transfers of cashcoins.
   8. redistributions of votecoin allocations 

Anyone with cashcoins may initiate any of the actions 1,3,4,5. Anyone with
votecoins will be obligated to initiate action 6. The miners will initiate
7 and 8. 

Each truthcoin-specific action is a bitcoin-like transaction where the output 
script designates one of the actions to be taken. The format of the output
script is simply:
 
   output_script =
         OP_PUSHxXX    number of bytes
         char          action_type
         {uint8}+      action_data
         OP_MARKET     0xc0

If viewed as a stack operation, action_type and action_data are simply pushed 
onto the stack and then OP_MARKET acts as an operation to (1) do the action 
specified by the action_type using action_data as inputs and (2) clear the 
stack with a TRUE result. The action_type byte will specify one of the 
truthcoin-specific actions 2-8 above.  The specific format for action_data is 
as follows.



Create Branch
-------------

  action_type = char        'B' (create_branch)
  action_data = string      name
                string      description
                uint64      baseListingFee
                uint16      freeDecisions
                uint16      targetDecisions
                uint16      maxDecisions
                uint64      minTradingFee
                uint16      tau (in block numbers)
                uint16      ballotTime (in block numbers)
                uint16      unsealTime (in block numbers)
                uint32      consensusThreshold

  Note 1: Each branch has its own set of votecoins. When a new branch is created,
  it is simply a many-address-to-many-address votecoin transaction along with a
  single create_branch action in the output list. The input votecoins will no
  longer be a part of their previous branches and the output votecoins will now
  be a part of the new branch.

  Note 2: Each block number ending in a multiple of tau denotes the start of a 
  voting period for the branch's recently ended decisions. The schedule is

     block number / range
     -----------------------------------   -----------------------------------
     n*tau                                 ballots available for all decisions 
                                              ending ((n-1)*tau, n*tau] 
     (n*tau, n*tau+ballotTime]             sealed ballots may be submitted
     (n*tau, n*tau+ballotTime+unsealTime)  unsealed ballots may be submitted
     n*tau + ballotTime + unsealTime       miner runs outcome algorithm
                                               
  We must have ballotTime + unsealTime less than tau so that the change of 
  votecoins in an outcome is set before the next run of the outcome algorithm.

  It is desireable to have tau correspond to approximately two weeks (for 10
  minute block spacing, tau = 2016).

  Note 3: The outcome algorithm is best when there are many decisions on a
  ballot, but not too many. The cost to create a decision for a ballot is thus
  structured to depend on how many decisions have already been created for 
  that specific ballot. The parameters 
       freeDecisions <= targetDecisions <= maxDecisions.
  are required.  For the N-th decision ending in (n-1)*tau, n*tau], the 
  "listing fee" cost to create another decision in that interval will be

     cost                                  N
     -----------------------------------   -----------------------------------
     0                                     [0, freeDecisions)
     baseListingFee                        [freeDecisions, targetDecisions)
     (N - targetDecisions)*baseListingFee  [targetDecisions, maxDecisions)
     impossible                            [maxDecisions,infty)

  Note 6: TODO: The creation of a new branch is a controlled process.
 

Create Decision
---------------

  action_type = char        'D' (create_decision)
  action_data = uint160     cashcoin public key
                uint256     branchid
                string      prompt
                uint32      eventOverBy (block number)
                uint8       is_scaled (0=false, 1=true)
                uint64      if scaled, minimum
                uint64      if scaled, maximum
                uint8       answer optionality (0=not optional, 1=optional)

  Note 1: The creator of the decision pays a listing fee according to the 
  branch parameters and will receive a portion of the trading fees of all
  markets on that decision. The outcome algorithm will allocate 25% of 
  each market's trading fees across the cashcoin public keys the market's
  decision list.


Create Market
-------------
     
  action_type = char        'M' (create_market)
  action_data = uint160     cashcoin public key
                uint64      B (liquidity parameter)
                uint64      tradingFee     
                string      title
                string      description
                string      tags (comma-separated strings)
                uint32      maturation (block number)
                varint      number of decisionids
                {uint256}+  decisionids
                {uint8}+    decisionFunctionids
                uint64      initial account value
     

  Note 1: The market will be dependent on the outcome of each decision
  in the list. The maturation is set to be the maximum of the decision's 
  eventOverBy numbers.
 
  Note 2: The market may depend on a function of the scaled decisions.
  The initial list of functions are

     id                                    f(X)
     ----------------------                ------------------ 
     X1 [default]                          X
     X2                                    X*X
     X3                                    X*X*X
     LNX1                                  LN(X)

  Note 3: TODO: B and initial account value



Create Trade
------------

  action_type = char        'T' (create_trade)
  action_data = uint160     cashcoin public key
                uint256     marketid
                uint8       isbuy
                uint64      number of shares
                uint64      price
                uint32      decision state
                uint32      nonce

  Note 1: TODO



Create Vote
-----------
     
  action_type = char        'V' (create_voteballot)
  action_data = uint160     votecoin public key
                varint      ndecisionids
                {uint256}+  decisionids
                {uint64}+   votes

     

Create Outcome
--------------

  action_type = char        'O' (publish_outcomes)
  action_data =   
                TODO
     
  action_type = char        'R' (redistribution of votecoins)
  action_data = varint      noutputs
                {output}+   output array (pay-to-pubkey-hash)
     




Additional
--------------

In order to avoid possible censorship by a miner, some of the actions have the
option to be done in a multi-step process. For the actions involving strings 
(create_branch, create_decision, create_market), any empty string field can be
filled in by the owner at any time afterward by creating a TODO...  

A create_voteballot  TODO...
